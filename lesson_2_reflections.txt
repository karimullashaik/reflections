What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It simply captures meta data of list of files that were in a directory that are not yet  added for commit .

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory contains the files that have been commited to the GIT whereas staging contains the files that are neither commited yet first time or files were modified
